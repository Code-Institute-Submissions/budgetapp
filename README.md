- In the middle section, as mentioned above, you will see "total budget", "expenses" and "balance", where balance is your total budget minus all the expenses you enter. 
- Finally, in the bottom section, you will find the list of all the expenses you have added.  In each of these expenses you will have a Penn button to edit the product, which will take you back to the Expenses section or delete it with the trash button.
- Also, when you edit or delete one of the expenses from the list, the balance is corrected automatically.
